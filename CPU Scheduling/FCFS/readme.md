#Task:

1. Suppose there are five processes in the ready queue with arrival time = 0. 

                        | Process ID | Burst Time |
                        |------------|------------|
                        | 0          | 4          |
                        | 1          | 3          |
                        | 2          | 2          |
                        | 3          | 1          |
                        | 4          | 3          |
                        
Calculate the waiting time and turn around time of each process. 
Also calculate the average waiting time and average turn around time which the 
processes have to face in the ready queue. 

2. Suppose now that there are five processes in the ready queue with different 
arrival times and burst times. 

                  | Process ID | Arrival Time | Burst Time |
                  |------------|--------------|------------|
                  | 0          | 3            | 4          |
                  | 1          | 5            | 3          |
                  | 2          | 0            | 2          |
                  | 3          | 5            | 1          |
                  | 4          | 4            | 3          |
                  
 Calculate the waiting time, turn around time, average waiting time and average turn 
 around time for the above set of processes in the ready queue.
